# goserveit
Go Lang server template

This is a sample template to build a server in Go using `net/http` package and
`gorilla mux` as muxer

## Getting Started

### Installing

Use Git to clone the repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mukeshm/goserveit.git
```

This will clone the goserveit into your local filesystem

### Running the server

```sh
# switch to your local repo
cd goserveit
go run *.go
```
This will run a server on default port `8080`, so we can open `http://localhost:8080` in browser
